# Description
This was another section of the flutter course in which we had to make a sort of business card app that contains some basic information about me and my work.__
This section covered many new aspects of a basic of front-end app designing as well as various new widgets that will surely come in handy in the future.__
I learned how to create grids using nested Rows and Columns widgets and then the ListTile widget: the widgets that can have multiple children. __
I also learned how different a Card widget is from the basic Container widget, how it doesnt have padding attribute built in itself, so we had to use the Padding class and encapsulate the Card widget inside it.__
All in All this section helped me to learn many new aspects of flutter.__



# Final Layout
This was the final layout i came up with. I tried to go with a dark mode type of stlye with colors chosen with the help of material 3
