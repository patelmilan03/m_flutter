# Description
This section of the course taught me the basics and how to use the modular components of the UI, using 'Stateful Widgets'. I learnt how statful widgets work and how they are different from stateless widgets.
I also learnt about the Expanded class, the Centre class, how to use TextButton and ExtendedButton.
There were also aspects of incorporating the knowledge of functions, creating them and calling them in between the regular designing code.

## Final Layout
This was the final layout i came up with. I tried to go with a dark mode type of style just like the previous layout.
